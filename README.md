## Asynchronous Multi-Channel PWM Control

The included code is written in microPython, prepared for a Raspberry Pi Pico. <br/>
The code provides control of 3 pwm outputs by default. It is possible to add up to 16 channels on a Raspberry Pi Pico.<br/>
The behavior is much like using the millis() function in Arduino, thus removing any delays and achieving asynchronous behaviors. The code was prepared for a project by Lucie Bombasaro at ESAM Caen/Cherbourg<br/>
